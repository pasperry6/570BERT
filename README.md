1) Explain how to run the experiments
2) Describe:
 a) Which code files have been copied from other repositories with references to these
repositories
 b) Which code files have been modified and how they have been modified
 c) Which code files are the student's original code.
3) Include a description of the datasets you used and where you obtained them.
